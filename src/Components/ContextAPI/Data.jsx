        para1:
          "SP Diana Joseph captures members of the Sikka Gang and confiscates a haul of cocaine worth 1,000 crores. An undercover officer Abbas Ali known as Raunak, has joined Ashwathama (known as Ashu) who is co-leader of the Sikka Gang. Raunak gives information about Ashu to Diana while Ashu seeks help from corrupt NCB officer Devraj Subramaniam who instructs another corrupt officer Deep Singh to add rohypnol to drinks made for police officers at the farewell party of IG Jayant Malik. Diana does not partake but everyone else falls unconscious. A prisoner named Bholaa has been released from prison and Joseph tries to convince him to drive a truck taking the sedated officers to the hospital then on to Laalganj police station . Although he is reluctant at first, he agrees. Meanwhile, Ashu hires a bounty hunter on Joseph and the rest of her police force. As Joseph, Bholaa and sidekick Kadchi drive they are attacked by various gangs. The mole Deep Singh, who has hidden with the sedated officers, provides them with the location updates. Bholaa reveals his fighting powers and kills all the goons. Ashu also sends his gang to attack the police station and to free his brother Nithari, who was caught with the cocaine. A new inspector, Angad Yadav, who was recently transferred to Laalganj, gets assigned by Joseph to defend the police station.",
        para2:
          "When Ashu arrives with his gang, they try to breach the police station which is barricaded by Yadav and some students. Joseph is nearly tricked into ordering the release of the prisoners but she realizes that it was a trap set by Nithari. Ashu manages to get inside the but Yadav and the students manage to arrest him. The student Chetan gets strangled to death by Ashu's gang with a lasso through a window and Yadav, fuming with rage, kills Ashu. Joseph contacts medics to provide an emergency ambulance at a temple of Lord Shiva. As they wait, Bholaa narrates his past to Kadchi: he was a notorious gangster in Uttar Pradesh and fell in love with a doctor named Swara, who reciprocated his love after he saved her from being sexually assaulted. Before their marriage, Bholaa gave up his gangster life, but Swara was killed by a ruthless gang leader known as Chomu. Before dying, Swara gave birth to their daughter, Jyoti but Bholaa got separated from her after receiving a long term prison sentence. Joseph shares her story about how she lost her unborn child when she was pregnant. An ambulance finally arrives and takes the sedated officers to hospital, then Ashu's big henchman Bhoora also turns up. Before Bholaa is able to fight, Deep Singh stabs him and he is brutally injured. While Jospeh and Kadchi are taken away, Abbas is killed when he is discovered as the mole. Bholaa later regains consciousness and single-handedly kills the whole gang, including Deep Singh, using the Trident of Lord Shiva. After this he chases after Bhoraa, rescuing Joseph. After driving all night, Bholaa, Kadchi and Diana arrive in Laalganj police station using a secret passage and help the students along with Yadav to escape safely. Joseph burns the cocaine and after Ashu's reinforced gang finally breaches station, Bholaa destroys them all using a M134 Minigun. Shortly after, Nithari dies of shock after learning about Bholaa, and Devraj Subramaniam shoots himself after knowing that Bholaa was behind everything. Bholaa is reunited with his daughter Jyoti and they drive off happily in theb truck with Kadchi and a puppy. In a mid-credits scene, Chomu Singh learns about Bholaa's release and decides to destroy him.",

          "Shantanu 'Shaan' Sengupta, a former Lieutenant in the Indian Navy, is currently working as a night manager in a premiere star hotel in Dhaka, amidst the Rohingya genocide in 2017. He is approached by Safina Kidwai, a 14 year-old girl married to the majority share owner of the star hotel, Freddie Rehman, to help her escape to India. Upon his refusal, she steals his phone and discreetly records a meeting in Shaan's phone between Shaildendra 'Shelly' Rungta and her Freddy, about buying and smuggling illegal arms into Bangladesh. She also takes pictures of the paperwork and returns the phone to Shaan, so that he can view everything. Upon seeing everything, he goes to his friend, Vikram Bhagwat, of the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, to share the information and evidence. Vikram, in-turn, sends the information to RAW officer, Lipika Saikia Rao, who is the in-charge of Bangladesh, in New Delhi. She has been keeping tabs on Shelly and believes that the evidence she received from Safina and Shaan is enough to officially go after him. She requests Shaan to keep Safina safe for a night, till she arrives in Dhaka the next afternoon. Meanwhile, both Freddie and Shelly come to know about their meeting being leaked; Shelly asks Freddie to kill Safina. He, along with his men, search the entire hotel for her. Shaan takes Safina to a new wing that is currently under construction in the star hotel, for safekeeping. The next day, as he goes out to get food for Safina, he calls Lipika to inquire about her current whereabouts, however, Lipika realizes that her phone has been bugged and orders Shaan to hurry back to Safina. He comes back just as Safina falls to her death from the wing. Her death is ruled as a suicide by the local police, who say that she stole jewelry from the high-profile guests in the hotel and jumped as she was caught. This devastates both Shaan and Lipika, knowing completely well that both Freddie and Shelly were behind her death. This prompts Shaan to leave his job.",

          "Two years later, Shaan now lives a reclusive life in Shimla, working as a night manager in a star resort. He is constantly haunted by his failure of not being able to save Safina back in Dhaka. However, one day, his superior tells him that Shelly, along with his associates, is coming to stay in the resort for a few days. Once they arrive, Shaan collects strong information, from the trash in his room, and mails it to Lipika. Over the course of his stay, Shelly constantly runs into Shaan. Each time, he is impressed with Shaan's demeanor. He even gives his coat to Shaan, as token of remembrance, as he leaves the resort. The next day, Shaan is visited by an undercover Lipika, who has now been demoted to the archives section of the agency. They both decide to infiltrate Shelly's syndicate. After a dramatic set-up orchestrated by Lipika and her co-worker, Sarang, Shaan is able to reach Sri Lanka, by posing as an international runaway, to get close to Shelly. He saves his son, Taha, in a fake kidnapping planned by Lipika. However, to further make it look real, he purposefully gets injured. Upon seeing and searching Shaan, both Shelly and his righ-hand man, Brij Pal alias BJ, find a Sri Lankan passport with a different alias, on him. They decide to take him with them, for his recuperation. Shaan, as a result, successfully infiltrates Shelly's gang and succeeds in creating chaos amongst them. Shaan eventually finds out that Shelly is on the verge of bankruptcy and plans to go to Riyadh, to meet Bargati, an oil baron, with the hopes of making a deal with him. He also finds out that he has an Indian partner going by the alias, Indra Dhanush. Using Shelly's lawyer, G. V., Lipika plants a set-up in Riyadh, to get BJ arrested, under homosexuality, which is banned in the Middle East. After it is successful, Shelly, with no other way out, offers Shaan the CEO position, which was previously occupied by BJ, for 30 days. Intending to take him out from the inside, Shaan happily agrees to the offer.",

          "The film chronicles the early part of the life of Emperor Asoka. It begins with his career as a General in Takshashila and ends with the bloody conquest of the Kalinga. Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, grandfather of Asoka, of the Maurya empire, has decided to embrace Jainism and abdicate the throne of the empire in favour of his son Bindusara. But his grandson, Prince Asoka, claims his sword. The old emperor explains that this sword is evil, and the sword demands blood and destruction. A few years later, Prince Asoka, now a brave youth, is battling the rebellious chief of Taxila for his Emperor and father. He figures that his elder half-brother Susima Maurya, who also has an eye on the throne of the empire, has deliberately withheld reinforcements from arriving, but defeats the enemy nevertheless. Asoka returns to the capital victorious and confronts Susima. Later, Susima tries to assassinate Asoka while he is bathing. The fight among the princes makes the Emperor unhappy, and he orders Empress Dharma to control her son Asoka. She compels Asoka to temporarily leave the capital to lead the life of a common person. The Prince is disappointed but leaves nonetheless. Asoka, alone and disguised as an ordinary traveller, rides to the south. In his travels, he meets a lovely maiden, Kaurwaki and falls in love with her. He also develops a good relationship with her little brother Arya. They are on the run from the Kingdom of Kalinga along with their faithful protector Bheema and are being chased by soldiers of the Kingdom. After saving their lives, Asoka introduces himself as Pawan, hiding his true identity. Kaurwaki and Arya are the Princess and Prince of Kalinga, who fled from their kingdom when the Prime Minister assassinated their parents and took over power. Later, Asoka and Kaurwaki get secretly married.",

          "Soon, Asoka is summoned by his mother, who sent a messenger to tell him she has fallen ill and to come to the capital. The Emperor dispatches Asoka to quell a rebellion in Ujjaini. Before marching to the west, Asoka travels to Kalinga to meet Kaurwaki and Arya. Unable to find them, and not knowing they have gone into hiding, he is informed by General Bheema that they were slaughtered. A heartbroken Asoka attempts suicide but is saved by Virat, who later swears to protect him. Mad with grief and anger, Asoka leads a brutal crackdown in Ujjaini. The assassins sent by Susima injure Asoka in a battle, and Virat saves him. He is taken to a Buddhist monastery at Vidisa to recover. There, he meets a Buddhist maiden, Devi, who cares for him. Asoka also survives another assassination attempt at Vidisa, this time with the help of Devi. Asoka marries Devi and returns in splendour to Pataliputra. Susima and his brothers are wild with anger from their futile attempts to eliminate Asoka. Emperor Bindusara, who favoured Susima over Asoka, becomes ill and dies. In another vigilante attack, Queen Dharma is stabbed to death by assassins sent by Susima. Angered, Asoka wants to kill Susima but has second thoughts, and Susima is killed by Virat when he tries to kill Asoka behind his back and is appointed emperor. A few months later, princess Kaurwaki and prince Arya return to Kalinga with Bheema and have the Prime Minister executed for treason. Asoka declares war on Kalinga, not knowing that Kaurwaki is alive. Kaurwaki still does not know that Asoka is Pawan, and both sides prepare for war. A terrible war is fought in Kalinga. The Maurya army inflicts a crushing defeat on Kalinga. Not content with the mere victory, Maurya soldiers butcher everyone in sight. General Bheema is killed after failing to assassinate Asoka realizing that he is Pawan and Kaurwaki is wounded. Asoka later visits the battlefield, where he discovers his horse, who was supposed to be in Kaurwaki's possession. With a surge of hope, he frantically searches for Kaurwaki and finds her. They have a heart-to-heart talk, and he apologises deeply for his actions. He is interrupted by Arya, who is dying after being pierced with arrows. With Arya dying in his arms, Asoka suddenly realises that his enemies, his family, and even Arya, are all dead because of him. His grandfather's warning about the sword had been correct. The film ends with Asoka throwing the sword into the water at the same spot as his grandfather, and embracing Buddhism. The final narrative describes how Asoka not only built a large empire but spread Buddhism and the winds of peace throughout the empire.",

          "After spending the entirety of the movie on dead leads and flailing around for some kind of a clue, Vidhi finally gets a callback from Rana’s (Kaushik Sen) aide, telling her that the leader of the Maoist-Naxalite movement wants to chat with her. Vidhi questions Rana about Ishan’s alleged connections with him, and he says that he once witnessed Ishan doing street plays and was impressed by his courage. After his final meeting with Ankita, Ishan was abducted by Varman’s goons, and he was taken away to be killed off. That’s when Rana apparently intervened and took Ishan to one of their safe houses. Rana told Ishan that he was free to leave their camp. But if he went out, he’d either be killed by Varman’s men or the cops. That’s why his only option was to join the movement and work towards achieving justice. So, that’s exactly what he did. Based on this information, Namita says that her brother is as good as dead for her, thereby sending the message that associating with Maoism or Naxalism is bad. Meanwhile, Vidhi withdraws her piece on Ishan because it is full of conjecture. ",
        para2:
          "In a final twist, Ishan appears in a video message to Ankita, warning her to postpone her and Varman’s return journey to Kolkata from his ancestral home because their convoy is going to be attacked. So, Varman sends his assistant and the rest of the convoy to their deaths while he stays back for a press conference and highlights how Maoists and Naxalites are the real villains of the state. Vidhi, in a state of panic, proclaims that Ishan has “predictably” joined the “dark side” and that it’s some kind of loss for her. But as soon as Ankita sends that video message to Vidhi, she lets go of the proverbial pearls she was clutching and sees Ishan’s warning to Ankita as a sign that he isn’t as bad as she was assuming. Vidhi doesn’t stop there, though. She turns this revelation about Ishan into some kind of personal moral victory, even though she has done little to nothing to influence Ishan or rectify the image of the outfit that he’s currently associated with. And I guess she conveys Ishan’s current status to his mother and sister, and they also walk back on their stance against Ishan. Going by Vidhi’s conversation with Jeet (Neil Bhoopalam) about the statistics that eventually show up before the credits begin to roll, “Lost” wanted to be a movie about people who go missing in and around Kolkata. But then they brought politics, Maoism, Naxalism, and journalism into it. Why? Do the director and the writers think those are the biggest reasons for people going missing in West Bengal? Or do they think that those are some of the reasons, out of a multitude of other factors, for which people go missing? Or do they think that politicians, Maoists, Naxalites, journalists, and the police should come together to prevent people from going missing? To be honest, I don’t know, and I am sure that the people behind “Lost” do not know either. It clearly has a throughline, but there are so many unbaked elements littered all around it that the topic of the unending missing persons’ cases never feels palpable. On a slightly tangential note, Chowdhury’s “Pink” was heavily criticized for robbing his female characters of any agency and letting a man speak for women’s rights. “Lost” does feel like his attempt to correct that by making a woman speak for herself, and the results are, to be polite, not good. So, be careful what you wish for.",

After multiple rejections from film producers and pressure from his family, he becomes a SI in the Himachal Pradesh Police, with the help of his brother-in-law Narinder Singh, a police officer himself. While Arjan does have a significant rank, he is treated like a rookie, due to lack of police experience. He moves in with his sister Seema, Narinder, and their daughter Payal. Payal gets into trouble in school and asks Arjan for help, so he meets her teacher Divya at school, posing as Payal's father, though soon exposed. He also befriends Divya's hearing and speech-impaired niece, Iti. Meanwhile, Arjan investigates the abduction of a school girl, Amrita. He finds similarities between Samiksha and Amrita's case, due to the mutilations on a doll found at Amrita's house. But his attempts to convince his superior officer, SHO Gudiya Parmar, go futile. A few days later, Amrita's mutilated corpse is found. The coroner suggests that the perpetrator's modus operandi is the same as Samiksha's. Over the next few days, another hearing impaired girl named Komal from Divya's school is abducted and killed. The search leads to Purushottam Tomar, a teacher at the new school Payal is enrolled in. Tomar is a pedophile who forces girls into fellatio. Payal herself narrowly escapes Purushottam Tomar when Arjan nabs him after getting a tip off from another victim. While trying to get a confession from him on the spot, Arjan discharges his service firearm. Tomar admits to being a sexual predator but denies the murder charges. In a bid to escape, he holds Parmar at gunpoint, but Arjan guns down Tomar.",

Finding an audio clip from Komal's hearing aid, he traces a piano tune back to a lady magician/pianist Agnes, who performed at all the victims' schools. Arjan informs his findings to SHO Parmar who believes him and re-appoints him on the case. Arjan finds that Agnes picks her victims by randomly calling them on to the stage, then kills them within the next few days and her next target would be a girl named Aisha. He tries to warn Aisha but despite constant surveillance, she is abducted. Arjan and his team track her location and save Aisha from being murdered. Agnes escapes, and goes to Divya's house, where she attacks Divya & kidnaps Iti. Arjan tracks Agnes to a nearby abandoned building, and discovers that Agnes is a man. The man reveals himself to be Christopher, the son of Agnes, who was arrested years ago after killing a young girl similar to the other victims. Christopher reveals that he has progeria, and was bullied when he was younger. A young girl, Sofia, became friends with him when he was younger, but when he confessed his love to her, she humiliated him. Agnes invited Sofia to her home some time later, where Agnes helped Christopher kill her. Agnes took the blame for the murder, but after her passing, Christopher decided to dress up as her and continue killing other girls, as they reminded him of Sofia. ",

Jasmine reveals her true name as Pallavi Sharma to Vihaan, and during an interrogation, the two extract information about who planned the attack. He chooses Seerat to be his pilot, who agrees wholeheartedly. Govind also suggests intensifying the artillery shelling at the border for distraction and painting their assault helicopters with Pakistani Air Force markings.

          "During the reign of Renzong Emperor, a group of European mercenaries travels to China, searching for the secret to gunpowder. A few miles north of the Great Wall, they are attacked by a monster. Only Irishman William Garin and Spaniard Pero Tovar survive. They sever the monster's arm and bring it with them. Upon reaching the Wall, they are taken prisoner by the Nameless Order. Led by General Shao and Strategist Wang, the Nameless Order exists to combat Tao Tie, alien monsters that arrived from a meteorite and attack once every sixty years.[7] The Order's commanders are surprised by the monsters' first assault, which has come one week early. Shortly after, a horde of Tao Tie assails the Wall. Both sides sustain heavy losses before the monsters' queen aborts the attack. During the battle, Garin and Tovar are freed by Ballard, another European who came east twenty-five years earlier; detained, he now serves as an English and Latin teacher. Garin and Tovar display amazing battle skills. Saving the life of young warrior Peng Yong, they slay two monsters, earning them the Order's respect. The three Europeans secretly plan to steal gunpowder and flee during the next monster attack. That night, two Tao Tie reach the top of the Wall. General Shao is killed, placing Commander Lin in charge of the Nameless Order. Around this time, an envoy from the capital arrives with an ancient scroll that suggests that the monsters are pacified by magnets. Wang believes the stone Garin carries enabled him to slay the Tao Tie he encountered. To test the hypothesis, Garin suggests they capture a Tao Tie alive and agrees to help. This delays the escape plans, angering Tovar, who nevertheless assists Garin despite Ballard's protests. While a new fight with the Tao Tie starts, the Westerners capture a monster and prove the theory. However, the Imperial envoy claims the creature and takes it to the capital to present to the Emperor.",
        para2:
          "It is revealed that the previous attacks had been a distraction so that the Tao Tie could dig a tunnel at the base of the Wall. While Lin investigates, Tovar and Ballard steal black powder and escape, knocking Garin unconscious for trying to stop them. Garin is arrested by the Nameless Order for his apparent betrayal and is locked up in the Wall. Some distance away, Ballard betrays and abandons Tovar. Ballard is later captured by bandits, who accidentally ignite the powder, killing the Westerner and themselves. At the capital, the envoy presents the captive Tao Tie to the Emperor. The creature awakens and reveals its position to its queen, who signals the Tao Tie to attack. The Order rushes to the capital. Lin orders the use of hot-air balloons and sets Garin free before leaving. Wang tells him to warn the outside world, but Garin boards the last balloon with Peng and Wang. They arrive just in time to save Lin from being devoured. They land in the Emperor's palace, where Wang proposes killing the queen by tying explosives to the captured Tao Tie and giving it meat to be delivered to the queen. While approaching the site, a horde of Tao Tie attack the band, and Peng sacrifices himself to save the others. After releasing the Tao Tie, Lin and Garin climb a tower so that Garin can detonate the explosives with an arrow. Wang sacrifices himself to buy time for Lin and Garin to reach the upper floors. Two of Garin's arrows are deflected by the Tao Tie queen's bodyguards, but Garin throws the magnet into the horde, creating a gap in the shields, allowing Lin's spear to get through. The queen is killed, and the rest of the horde is paralyzed. With the threat eliminated, Garin is allowed to return home and elects to take Tovar (whom the Nameless Order recaptured) with him instead of a reward of black powder, much to Tovar's annoyance.",

Arthur suffers from a neurological disorder that causes him to have random, uncontrollable laughing fits, requiring medication for which he depends on social services. After Arthur is attacked by juvenile delinquents, his co-worker Randall gives him a revolver for self-defense. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie, and invites her to see his routine at a comedy club. Arthur is fired from his job at a childrens hospital when he accidentally exposes the gun despite his explanation that it was given to him by Randall, who denies this. While riding home on the subway still wearing his clown makeup, Arthur is mocked and beaten by drunk businessmen from Wayne Investments; he fatally shoots two of them in self-defense and murders the third as he attempts to flee. The killings are condemned by their employer, billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne. Protesters begin donning clown masks in Arthurs image. Budget cuts shut down the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication. Sophie attends Arthurs stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably, and his jokes fall flat. Arthur intercepts a letter from Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. He goes to Wayne Manor, where he meets Thomass young son Bruce, but flees after a scuffle with family butler Alfred Pennyworth. Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized. Arthurs idol, popular late-night talk show host Murray Franklin, presents clips of Arthurs failed performance on his show and mocks him.",

In denial, Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and steals Penny's file, which states she was a narcissist who adopted Arthur while working as a housekeeper for the Waynes in the 1950s. Penny then raised Arthur with her abusive boyfriend, who later died in jail. Penny was sent to Arkham for allowing the abuse. Distraught, Arthur enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie asks him to leave, revealing their relationship to be a figment of Arthur's imagination. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny to death at the hospital. After his stand-up clips go viral, Arthur is invited to appear on Murray's show. He subsequently plans to commit suicide during the broadcast. While crafting a clown-inspired persona, he is visited by Randall and another ex-colleague, Gary. Arthur kills Randall, but spares Gary for his kindness to Arthur in the past. Two detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the murders of the businessmen pursue him onto a subway filled with clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots and kills a protester, thus inciting a riot, while Arthur escapes. Before the show goes live, Arthur asks Murray to introduce him as 'Joker'. Arthur begins telling morbid jokes, confesses to the subway murders, rants about how society abandons the downtrodden and mentally ill, and berates Murray for ridiculing him. After one more morbid joke, Arthur fatally shoots him on air. He is arrested, and riots erupt across Gotham. One of the rioters corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife, sparing Bruce. Rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur, freeing him; he stands atop the car, starts to dance to the cheers of the crowd, and smears blood on his face into the shape of a smile.",

Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a great part of his power, to dominate the other Rings to conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of Men and Elves battles Sauron's forces in Mordor. Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron's finger and the Ring with it, thereby vanquishing Sauron and returning him to spirit form. With Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. The Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself and is later killed by Orcs. The Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for over four and a half centuries. The ring abandons Gollum and it is subsequently found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is unaware of its history. Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, the wizard Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo departs the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew Frodo. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and tortured by Sauron's Orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: 'Shire' and 'Baggins.' Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo departs with his friend, gardener Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the wizard Saruman, but discovers his betrayal and alliance with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine undead Nazgûl servants to find Frodo.

However, Gandalf never arrives, having been taken prisoner by Saruman. The hobbits are then aided by a Ranger named Strider, who promises to escort them to Rivendell; however, they are ambushed by the Nazgûl on Weathertop, and their leader, the Witch-King, stabs Frodo with a Morgul blade. Arwen, an Elf and Strider's beloved, locates Strider and rescues Frodo, summoning flood-waters that sweep the Nazgûl away. She takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed by the Elves. Frodo meets with Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on a Great Eagle. That night, Strider reunites with Arwen, and they affirm their love for each other. Learning of Saruman's betrayal from Gandalf and now realizing that they are facing threats from both Sauron and Saruman, Arwen's father, Lord Elrond, decides against keeping the Ring in Rivendell. He holds a council of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, also attended by Frodo and Gandalf, that decides the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Elf Legolas, Dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider—who is actually Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of mithril. ",

It can control steering, acceleration and braking but a camera will monitor a driver's eyes so they stay alert. The technology will only be available for 2023 models of Ford's electric Mustang Mach-E SUV at first. It also means the model can keep a safe distance from other cars and even bring them to a complete stop in traffic jams. Thatcham Research, an automotive research firm, said it was important to note that this is not a self-driving car but is 'the next development in assisted driving technology'. 'What makes it different, is that for the first time ever drivers will be permitted to take their hands off the wheel. However, their eyes must remain on the road ahead, ' said Tom Leggett, vehicle technology specialist at Thatcham. He added: 'Crucially, the driver is not permitted to use their mobile, fall asleep or conduct any activity that takes attention away from the road'. Ford's car costs £50,830 and while the hands-off technology will be free for the first 90 days, drivers will then have to sign up for a monthly subscription. Deliveries of the new model started last month. It has a maximum speed of 80mph and uses both cameras and sensors to detect lane markings and speed signs, as well as the position and speed of other cars on the road.",

Lisa Brankin, managing director of Ford in Britain and Ireland, also told the BBC's Today programme on Friday that the car will only take over when 'the system feels it's safe' in certain 'blue zones' that have been deemed as safe across 2,300 miles of pre-mapped motorways in England, Scotland and Wales. 'If your eyes are closed, the car will prompt you to put hands onto the steering wheel and take control… It will keep prompting the driver and if they dont respond, the car will steadily slow down to a stop,' she said. She adds that in the case of accidents, the driver will still be fully responsible in insurance claims, as the technology is 'not autonomous driving' and the driver is in control.",

There are also a lot of libraries, components for creating animation in React. Let’s talk about them",
        para2: "CSS method is one of the best for a simple animation. When you use it instead of importing javascript libraries, your bundle remains small. And browser spends fewer resources. These two points also largely impact app productivity. If you have a simple animation and worry about the size of your bundle pay attention to this method.  ReactTransitionGroup This add-on component has been developed by guys from ReactJs community. ReactTransitionGroup is easy to implement basic CSS animations and transitions. React-animations — the library is built on all animations with animate.css. It is easy to use and has a lot of animation collections. React-animation works with any inline style library that supports the use of objects to define keyframe animations, such as Radium, Aphrodite or styled-components. I prefer to use the styled-components. React Reveal is an animation framework for React. It has basic animations such as fade, flip, zoom, rotate and a lot of more advanced animations. It allows you to control all animations with props, for example: the position, delay, distance, cascade and many others. You can see them here. You can also use the custom css effects. Also it has server side rendering and high order components. If you prefer to use animation on scroll this framework for you. Check out how it works. Ant Design is a React UI library that is a plethora of easy to use components. It is useful component for building the elegant user interfaces.

      content: {
        para1: "A few years ago, a computer scientist named Yejin Choi gave a presentation at an artificial-intelligence conference in New Orleans. On a screen, she projected a frame from a newscast where two anchors appeared before the headline “cheeseburger stabbing.” Choi explained that human beings find it easy to discern the outlines of the story from those two words alone. Had someone stabbed a cheeseburger? Probably not. Had a cheeseburger been used to stab a person? Also unlikely. Had a cheeseburger stabbed a cheeseburger? Impossible. The only plausible scenario was that someone had stabbed someone else over a cheeseburger. Computers, Choi said, are puzzled by this kind of problem. They lack the common sense to dismiss the possibility of food-on-food crime. For certain kinds of tasks—playing chess, detecting tumors—artificial intelligence can rival or surpass human thinking. But the broader world presents endless unforeseen circumstances, and there A.I. often stumbles. Researchers speak of “corner cases,” which lie on the outskirts of the likely or anticipated; in such situations, human minds can rely on common sense to carry them through, but A.I. systems, which depend on prescribed rules or learned associations, often fail.",
        para2: "By definition, common sense is something everyone has; it doesn’t sound like a big deal. But imagine living without it and it comes into clearer focus. Suppose you’re a robot visiting a carnival, and you confront a fun-house mirror; bereft of common sense, you might wonder if your body has suddenly changed. On the way home, you see that a fire hydrant has erupted, showering the road; you can’t determine if it’s safe to drive through the spray. You park outside a drugstore, and a man on the sidewalk screams for help, bleeding profusely. Are you allowed to grab bandages from the store without waiting in line to pay? At home, there’s a news report—something about a cheeseburger stabbing. As a human being, you can draw on a vast reservoir of implicit knowledge to interpret these situations. You do so all the time, because life is cornery. A.I.s are likely to get stuck. Oren Etzioni, the C.E.O. of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, in Seattle, told me that common sense is “the dark matter” of A.I. It “shapes so much of what we do and what we need to do, and yet it’s ineffable,” he added. The Allen Institute is working on the topic with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (darpa), which launched a four-year, seventy-million-dollar effort called Machine Common Sense in 2019. If computer scientists could give their A.I. systems common sense, many thorny problems would be solved. As one review article noted, A.I. looking at a sliver of wood peeking above a table would know that it was probably part of a chair, rather than a random plank. A language-translation system could untangle ambiguities and double meanings. A house-cleaning robot would understand that a cat should be neither disposed of nor placed in a drawer. Such systems would be able to function in the world because they possess the kind of knowledge we take for granted.",

      content: {
        para1: "The person in charge of digital transformation at a company might be the chief information officer, the chief digital officer, or someone in another role. Regardless of title, that person is ultimately the “transformer in chief,” according to George Corbin, the chief operating officer at the travel marketplace Onriva. This role is difficult on several fronts. “You’re trying to create and lead a movement across an organization. You’re the ship’s helmsman and the ship’s engineer — you’re on the bridge setting direction and navigating the storm, and at the same time you’re down in the engine room actually making things work,” Corbin said during a panel discussion about digital leadership at the recent MIT Sloan CIO Symposium. Transformation boils down to three key elements, he said. Most leaders know they need to focus on data and technology architecture. It’s also important to consider business model architecture, such as product development and go-to-market strategy, and human architecture (such as organizational charts and incentive structures). ",
        para2: "Leaders outlined five areas of focus for today’s executives tasked with digital transformation: Clarity is the most important element of any innovation, Corbin said. He cited the example of Peter Blake, the leader of the New Zealand sailing team that beat the United States in back-to-back America’s Cup competitions in the 1990s. Blake focused every strategic decision — from crew training to equipment design — on a single question: Will it make the boat go faster? Agility- The sprint isn’t just for engineering teams anymore. Marketing, sales, and other business units should be prepared to evaluate their work on a two-week cadence and course correct as needed. Speed is an obvious benefit, but it’s what makes the speed possible — the coordination of schedules and deadlines — that transforms the business. Risk Management - Fear is the death of any innovation. While this fear comes in many forms, it often boils down to the expectation that if other business units are generating $1 billion a year, then the innovation initiative should be generating $1 billion a year, too. Ownership - Organizations need to move away from the idea that business functions own their data sets, Bellini said. Different business units own the responsibility for managing the process, but “the beauty and the value of data come in really breaking the silos and going cross-functional,” she said. Loss management - For all the benefits of digital transformation, organizations need to recognize that someone will lose. Automating a complex manual process will streamline operations, improve efficiency, and generate savings, but it will also threaten the job security of whomever owned that process for the last decade.",

        para1: 'The results of tracking lung cancers for nine years left the research team "surprised" and "in awe" at the formidable force they were up against. They have concluded we need more focus on prevention, with a "universal" cure unlikely any time soon. Cancer Research UK said early detection of cancer was vitally important. The study - entitled TracerX - provides the most in-depth analysis of how cancers evolve and what causes them to spread. Cancers change and evolve over time - they are not fixed and immutable. They can become more aggressive: better at evading the immune system and able to spread around the body. A tumour starts as a single, corrupted cell, but becomes a mixture of millions of cells that have all mutated in slightly different ways. TracerX tracked that diversity and how it changes over time inside lung cancer patients and say the results would apply across different types of cancer. "That has never been done before at this scale," said Prof Charles Swanton, from the Francis Crick Institute and University College London. More than 400 people - treated at 13 hospitals in the UK - had biopsies taken from different parts of their lung cancer as the disease progressed. "It has surprised me how adaptable tumours can be," Prof Swanton told me. "I don\'t want to sound too depressing about this, but I think - given the almost infinite possibilities in which a tumour can evolve, and the very large number of cells in a late-stage tumour, which could be several hundred billion cells - then achieving cures in all patients with late-stage disease is a formidable task."        ',
        para2: 'Prof Swanton said: "I don\'t think we\'re going to be able to come up with universal cures. "If we want to make the biggest impact we need to focus on prevention, early detection and early detection of relapse." Obesity, smoking, alcohol and poor diet all increase the risk of some cancers. Tackling inflammation in the body is also being seen as a way of preventing cancer. Inflammation is the likely explanation for air pollution causing lung cancers and inflammatory bowel disease increasing the risk of colon cancer. The researchers hope the findings could, in the future, help them predict how a patient\'s tumour will spread and to tailor treatment. Dr David Crosby, the head of prevention and early detection at Cancer Research UK, said: "The exciting results emerging from TracerX improve our understanding that cancer is a disease which evolves as it progresses, meaning that late-stage cancers can become very hard to treat successfully. "This underscores the crucial importance of further research to help us to detect cancers at the earliest stages of their development or even better, to prevent them from happening at all."',

One speciality of vipassana is focuses on natural things. we don't have to chant and hymns here. we just watch the breath and breath is related to our mind. Vipassana is the combination of the two words: \"vi\" and  \"passana\". Passana means to see and Vi means to see in a special way. Goutam Buddha is the main researcher of this Vipassana method. The first step starts with \"Anapana\". Anapana refers to the technique of watching the inhalation and exhalation. For that the entire meditation is centred around the nose. The main aim of Anapana is to keep one's mind stable and focused. We need to choose a peaceful place and sit in a cross-legged position.

Vipassana meditation is all about becoming aware of the things happening in the present moment. In our campus we conduct breath watching practise for three days. we increase the duration every evening. This makes a maditator's mind capable. If our mind is pure we will be friendly to others, we will have campassion for others, be joyful of others progress and service. This will help us cultivate good behaviours. People coming here can meditate not just be sitting in one place but also walking around. This is called \"Chankaraman\" or walking meditation. If we do vipassana then the fear and angst we have will go away and our mind will be stable and peaceful. We can develop the capacity to deal with whatever situation - be it good or bad ",

Seven different postures or Asana are done cyclically into a specific 12 steps pattern in a Surya Namaskar. It is known to be an effective cardiovascular workout and has a greatly positive impact on the human body and mind.

Surya Namaskar can be done at any time of the day. However, the best time to do Surya Namaskar is at sunrise as exposure to the sun activates our solar plexus.  Don’t eat or drink immediately before and after doing Surya Namaskar. Before practicing Surya Namaskar, an adequate warm-up should be done. It should be properly synchronized with breathing. If you have any medical problem, please consult your doctor. Surya Namaskara should be avoided during the menstrual period and pregnancy. It should be performed in a peaceful place with fresh air. Do practice on a daily basis to help your body get used to the process. Do follow the instructions properly to maintain the correct body posture. Don’t try to hold complicated postures for too long as it could result in an injury. Try not to get distracted while doing the Surya Namaskar as it can hinder the results. Wear comfortable clothing that allows you to perform the Surya Namaskar comfortably and without getting in the way. As Surya Namaskar involves full-body movements and stretching, it helps to shed the extra fat from your body. Some clinical studies have shown that Surya Namaskar is effective in weight loss.",

Mind you, this applies to facilities that identify only as gyms, and not as gyms and fitness centers or health clubs.",
        para2: "Sleep and exercise are said to be perfect bedfellows. A good night’s sleep can enhance workout performance, reduce the risk of injuries, and keep the body and muscles healthy. Lack of sleep, on the other hand, can weaken one’s immunity. Exercise has a chemical effect by creating more adenosine in the brain, and adenosine makes us feel sleepy. Some recent studies have found that high-intensity exercise results in a significant increase of the sleep-promoting substance adenosine. It is widely understood that physical activity leads to the body becoming fatigued and, therefore, boosts sleep. What is also important is that it contributes to overall health in a big way. “This is because physical activity is known to improve the quality as well as duration of sleep,” says Dr Sudheer Kumar Tyagi, a neurosurgeon with Apollo Hospitals, Delhi. “It is actually a kind of a treatment for people who suffer from insomnia and helps in stopping the usage of sleeping pills, which may be detrimental in the long run.” But high-intensity workouts done too close to bedtime can interfere with sleep patterns in most people — barring athletes, whose bodies are used to a different level of activity altogether. “When we need to check whether we are healthy or not, we need to see whether we can fall asleep naturally and wake up naturally,” says Dr Pallavi Aga, nutritionist and lifestyle management consultant, Mind, Body and Wellness Clinic, Noida, Uttar Pradesh. “That really is the hallmark of good health.”",

It boosts your energy level and make you active and productive during summer. “The summer lasts only for a couple of months in any demographic region, but our habit is to pull out that carbonated drink from the refrigerator.

Experts recommend naturally available drinks for summer that are better for your health. Aam panna (Raw mango juice), Benefits: Keeps an individual hydrated and reduces the feeling of dizziness that occurs due to heat in summers. It protects the body from heat strokes and is a good source of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2. Lemonade, Benefits: It helps in maintaining the electrolyte balance in the body as it acts as a natural electrolyte (sodium/potassium) supplier for the body. Buttermilk, Benefits: Made of curdled milk, it helps in digestion and neutralizing stomach acid, as they are high on probiotics; reduces sweating and helps stay hydrated. Tender coconut water, Benefits: It helps recover from heat stroke and gives instant relief and hydration during summer. It is high in potassium and hence helps in electrolyte balancing within the body. Fruit juices, Benefits: Fresh fruit juices or fruit smoothies are a good source of hydration during summer. This helps in energizing and being productive. Vegetable juice also makes us feel full.",

This \"festival of colours\" celebrates the arrival of spring and, like most Indian festivals, is associated with myths and legends that commemorate the triumph of good over evil. It's celebrated across the country, but is more prominent in North India, where it's marked by people smearing coloured powder on their faces and bodies and drenching each other with coloured water. The celebrations also include indulging in gujiya, a crescent-shaped pastry encasing a sweet mixture of khoya (milk solids), powdered sugar and nuts that's deep-fried to a golden-brown colour. It's flaky and crumbly on the outside, giving way to a soft and sweet filling. Almost every Indian state has its own version, with different dough, fillings and names. While it's called gujiya in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, elsewhere it's known as pedakiya (Bihar), ghughra (Gujarat), karanji (Maharashtra), karigadubu/karjikayi (Karnataka), somasi (Tamil Nadu) and garijalu/kajjikayalu (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana). Gujiya is also made during the festival of Diwali, but the North Indian versions are firmly identified with Holi.",
        para2: "\"Nothing signifies the changing seasons as do Holi and gujiya; the two are inextricably linked,\" said cookbook author Nandita Iyer, whose book The Great Indian Thali: Seasonal Vegetarian Wholesomeness was published in September 2022. In the book, she describes gujiya as the \"hallmark sweet\" of the season and the festival. And yet, there's no definitive history to gujiya, or even its association with the festival. One popular reference links it to a 13th-Century predecessor, a sundried snack of honey and jaggery (boiled unrefined cane sugar) coated with wheat flour. Another insists that it originated in central India's Bundelkhand region (comprising parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh) sometime in the 16th-17th Centuries. There is also speculation that it could derive from the Turkish baklava or the Central Asian samsa (the predecessor to a samosa); the former potentially brought by Muslim traders in the 13th-14th Centuries, the latter through chefs employed in the kitchens of the Mughal Empire around the 15th-16th Centuries.",

Crisscrossing this green lung are the backwaters that snake their way through towns and villages. Teeming with aquatic life and providing an invaluable resource to all who sit on their banks, these waterways have helped create an impossibly lush pocket of India. The backwaters are a network of interconnecting canals, rivers, lakes and inlets that weave their way through sprawling plantations and paddy fields. With around 900km of accessible water, one of the best ways to explore the area is by boat, navigating your way through the emerald labyrinth past water lilies and coconut groves that lean over the banks as if to take in a long, refreshing drink. The wider canals and lakes are used by local ferries and larger boats, but there are plenty of narrower tributaries to explore. Gliding along the watererways you’ll pass villages where life revolves around coir making and prawn farming as well as larger towns such as Alleppey, historically one of the most important trading ports along the Malabar Coast. Kerala’s history is closely linked to trade and commerce with Greek, Roman and Arab merchants coming to deal in cardamon, pepper and ginger. An abundance of spices, fresh fish and coconut means Kerala produces some of the best food in India.

The word paratha derives from the Sanskrit word atta meaning ‘layers of cooked dough,’ and this dish lives up to its moniker. After leaving the dough (or atta) to rest overnight, parathas are made by cooking the dough on a tava before shallow frying. The most common way to eat parathas is to stuff them with a filling of your choosing. Parathas can be stuffed with any number of fillings, but some of our favourites are aloo paratha (stuffed with potatoes) and methi paratha (stuffed with fenugreek). ",
        para2: "The largest city in Punjab and the centre of the Sikh faith, Amritsar is a fascinating and tangibly spiritual destination. It is both a bustling Indian city and a serene place of pilgrimage, and few fail to be moved by its splendour. At the heart of the city is the magnificent Harmandir Sahib, more commonly known as The Golden Temple. This richly gilded shrine rises from the middle of an artificial lake, the Amrita Saras, which translates as Pool of Nectar. Visit in the early hours and the temple is bathed in the soft glow of the morning light, its reflection shimmering in the waters. The evenings are the best time to listen to the music and recitations of the Granth Sahbib, the holy book. Scores of turbaned Sikhs come to worship and bathe in the sacred waters with most people trying to come at least once in their lifetime, not just from within India but all around the world. The deep spirituality that surrounds the temple and the hum of devotional chanting is something that touches all who visit and just taking a seat around the pool and soaking up the atmosphere is one of the best ways to appreciate this very special place.",

        para1: "Hailed as the regional dish of northwest India, the Gujarati delicacy dhokla is a savoury vegetarian snack made of rice and split chickpeas. It’s tastier than it sounds – Gujaratis eat it for breakfast or lunch, and sometimes even as a snack or side dish. Another dish that takes hours of preparation, dhokla involves soaking the rice and split chickpeas in equal quantities overnight. Then, chilli, coriander, ginger and baking soda are added to add spice to the dish, and help it rise into delicious bite size morsels. Usually served alongside deep fried chilli and  coriander chutney, this Gujarati delicacy is wonderfully moreish. ",

Predictably, these milk-based sweets are made from milk powder, condensed milk, ghee and cardamom powder. Barfi is not going to help anyone reach their health-conscious goals, but these indulgent fragrant desserts are sure to bring a smile to the face of anyone who tries them. These sweets are traditionally gifted as good luck offerings at occasions like wedding ceremonies, but there’s nothing to say you can’t pop down to the sweet shop to buy one to accompany your afternoon chai.
